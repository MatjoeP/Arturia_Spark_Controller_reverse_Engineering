# Arturia_Spark_Controller_reverse_Engineering
I'd love to keep on using the hardware even after the Spark plug-ins and/or standalone will eventually get completely obsolete by lack of support from Arturia who dropped the whole Spark Project all together.
Sparks would make a murderous dedicated Drum Controllers in every DAW that supports controller Scripting. 
Therefore,  I'm looking for help to complete the reverse engineering of both controllers. 

Check the spreadsheet to see my progresses

So far I figured:
- all midi messages from all knobs and buttons for both controllers
- all messages for Turning all lights ON 

What I can't figure out:
- Turning Lights OFF
- Sysex messages ( which I guess perform controller Identification handshakes and LCD Screen handling on the Spark CDM)

Arturia would not give me the Protocol. I am so close, but yet so far...

Any help appreciated.
